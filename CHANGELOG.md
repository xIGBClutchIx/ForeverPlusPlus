# Changelog

What changed in each release of Forever++. The same notes show in game under Settings > AddOns > Forever++ > Changelog, from [`ForeverPlusPlus/Changelog.lua`](ForeverPlusPlus/Changelog.lua); change both together.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **AddOns List**: the new AddOn Sets option (off by default) adds a Sets dropdown beside Disable All, to save which addons are on under a name and turn that set back on later.
- **Auto Decline**: the new Guild Invites and Guild Charters options (off by default) turn down guild invites and requests to sign a guild charter, even from friends and guildmates.
- **Comprehend Scrolls**: a new module for Mages: right-click a scroll you read with Comprehension in your bags to cast Comprehend Scroll on it, without opening the spellbook. Not in combat. On by default; it does nothing for characters without the spell.
- **Combat Alert**: the new Play Sound option (off by default) plays the raid warning sound as you enter combat and a soft chime as you leave, for when you're looking somewhere else.
- **Fishing Cast**: the new Louder Bobber option (off by default) turns sound effects up and music down while you fish, so the splash is easy to hear, and puts your own volumes back after you stop, even after a reload or disconnect mid-cast.
- **Item Tooltips**: the new Repair Cost line (off by default) shows what repairing damaged gear costs, on gear you wear or carry, without a merchant's repair cursor.
- **Flight Timer**: the new Sound on Landing option (off by default) plays the ready check sound a few seconds before you land, on a flight you've taken before, so you can tab out on long flights.
- **Forever Quest Icons**: the new Quest Details option (on by default) puts the icon after the quest's name at the top of its details, in the quest window and on the map.
- **Minimap Node Icons**: a new module that puts the herb's or ore's own icon on each tracking dot on the minimap while Find Herbs or Find Minerals is on. Off by default. Its Tint Unusable option (off by default) turns an icon red while your skill is too low to gather it, and Gray Out Trivial (off by default) turns it gray once gathering it no longer raises your skill.
- **NPC Nameplates**: the new Skip Pets, Skip Totems, and Skip Companions options (off by default) leave players' pets and minions, totems, or companions with Blizzard's own nameplate instead of a name and title.
- **Profiler**: a new page in Settings (`/fpp profile`) that records how much CPU each module takes, heaviest first, beside Forever++'s total CPU and memory. A module made of parts folds open to show what each part takes. Nothing is timed until you press Record.
- **Quest Levels**: a new module that shows a quest's level before its name, like the quest log's [12], in a quest giver's list and at the top of the quest's details. On by default. Its Color by Difficulty option (off by default) colors the level gray through red by how it compares with yours.
- **Quest Tracker**: the new Current Zone Only option (off by default) tracks only the quests of the zone you're in, and tracks the others again when you get there. The quest your map follows always shows.
- **Talent Planner**: the new Level-Up Reminder option (off by default) says in chat which talent your plan takes next when you gain a talent point.
- **Tooltips**: the new Hide Health Bar option (off by default) hides the green health bar under player and NPC tooltips.
- **Unusable Items Tint**: the new Auction House and Loot options (off by default) tint red the items you can't use in the auction house's search results, and in the loot window and on loot rolls.
- **Waylaid Crates**: a new module for filling Waylaid Crates. Its Waylaid Crates entry in the auction house's categories lists every item your crates still need, less what's already in your bags and bank.
- **Waypoints**: the new Follow Selected Quest option (on by default) points the arrow to the quest selected on the map instead of your map pin, and back to the pin when no quest is selected. Its Show Quest Name option (on by default) shows the quest's name under the distance.
- **Waypoints**: the new Point to Corpse option (on by default) points the arrow to your corpse while you're a ghost, ahead of a quest or your map pin, and back to them once you're alive.
- **Waypoints**: the new Clear Pin on Arrival option (off by default) takes your map pin away once you reach it.
- **XP Bar Text**: the new Fill Bar with Ready Quests option (on by default) fills the experience bar on from your XP in green with what your quests ready to turn in will give, like rested XP.
- **XP Bar Text**: the new Detailed Tooltip option (on by default) adds to the bar's tooltip the XP left to level, your rested XP, the XP of your quests, and your XP per hour and time to level since you logged in.
- **XP Bar Text**: the new Green When Quests Level You option (on by default) turns off the green quest XP text shown once turning those quests in would level you.
- **Auto Release**: the new Skip Key option (None by default) lets you hold a key while you're dead to stay where you fell.
- **Settings**: an option you've changed has an undo arrow at the end of its row that sets it back to its default, and its tooltip says what the default is.

### Changed

- **Auto Weapon Buff**: an item it doesn't know yet, or a stone on a fist weapon, works from a right-click too once you've put it on that kind of weapon by hand, for every character.
- **Quest Tracker**: Fade in Combat has a Combat Opacity slider, from 0 to 80%, for how faint the tracker gets in combat. It starts at 30%, as before.
- **Waylaid Crates**: Item Tooltips' Waylaid Crate Costs option moved here as Bundle Costs, keeping your choice.
- **World Map**: Coordinates follows Blizzard's coordinate settings under Gameplay > Interface instead of its own checkboxes, which turned them back on at every login.
- **World Map**: dungeon levels come from the game's dungeon finder, and Forever dungeons it lists that Forever++ didn't know get their names and levels in map tooltips.
- **World Map**: Zone Info shows the game's own level range for a zone when it has one. Points of Interest places flight masters where a flight master's map shows them and adds ones its list lacks, and Unexplored Areas adds areas its art lacks once one of your characters explores them.
- **Quest Tracker**: Font Size is gone: Edit Mode's Text Size sets the tracker's size.
- **Profession Tooltips**: on a lockbox whose tooltip already says what Lockpicking it needs, colors that line instead of adding a second one, and remembers the skill, so a box Forever changed shows the right number.
- **Settings**: the Modules page has new Character, Quests, System, and Units categories, listed in alphabetical order.
- **Settings**: Hold Shift to Skip and Hold Shift to Watch are now Skip Key and Watch Key dropdowns (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or None), like Auto Quest's.
- **Settings**: options look and read the same across modules: Item Tooltips' parts each have an Enabled checkbox, sliders are shorter, buttons that throw away data say Clear, and modules say when a Blizzard setting they need is off.
- **Settings**: Forever++ saves only the settings you change, so a better default reaches you, and saves talent plans and learned flight points for each character. Saved auction prices take about 60% less room. Everything you had carries over.
- **Commands**: `/fpp reset` asks first, and module names in `/fpp` match their titles, such as `/fpp toggle BagSlotCounter`.
- **Chat Copy**: copies everything the chat window holds. The Lines slider is gone, since a window keeps only its last 128 lines.
- **Chat History**: Lines Saved goes up to 125, about all a chat window holds.
- **Chat History**: saves each character's chat on its own, so an alt doesn't log in to another character's. The first character you log in with keeps the chat saved before.
- **Auto Screenshot**: Played Time on Level Up sits under Level Up and works only while Level Up is on, since it's for that screenshot.
- **Already Known**: the Loot option also marks known items on group loot rolls, before you choose Need or Greed.
- **Auto Sell Junk**: Keep Everything Buyable Back sells only as much junk as the buyback list has room for beside what you sold yourself, so an item sold by mistake stays buyable.
- **Auto Gossip**: learns which kind of NPC an option is for from the window it opens, so a banker, vendor, trainer, or flight master the game marks differently is picked by its own checkbox after you pick it once.
- **Bag Slot Counter**: the count turns orange when 4 or fewer slots are free. The new Color When Low option sets that number, or turns the colors off.
- **Currency Bar**: with nothing to show, it says how to track currencies instead of showing an empty box.
- **Error Catcher**: says on its Settings page, instead of in chat, when another addon such as BugGrabber is catching Lua errors, and leaves Blizzard's error window and blocked action popup to it.
- **Flight Timer**: the flight map tooltip's Flight Time line looks like the Sell Price line, with the time at the right. The new Tooltip Line option puts it back on one line, white or gray.
- **Profession Tooltips**: learns herbs and veins it doesn't know, and a skill Forever changed, from the game's own "Requires Herbalism" line, so it works in any language.
- **Minimap Button**: Shift-click it, instead of Shift-right-click, to see the errors, and Alt-click it to clear this session's. Clear Key is Alt by default and works with a click instead of a right-click.
- **Minimap Button**: the right-click menu also turns Auto Decline, Auto Dismount, Auto Gossip, Auto Release, Auto Repair, Auto Screenshot, Minimap Node Icons, Movable Framerate, and Skip Cinematics on and off, and lists its modules in alphabetical order.
- **Short Channel Names**: the Style dropdown also offers initials ([LFG] for LookingForGroup) and the name without its zone ([General]), alone or after the number. Number and Initials ([1. LFG]) is the new default.
- **Short Channel Names**: the new Guild, Party, and Raid option (on by default) also shortens [Guild], [Officer], [Party], [Raid], [Raid Warning], and [Instance] to [GD], [O], [P], [R], [RW], and [I].
- Buff Timers, Waypoints, Quest Tracker, Quest Nameplates, Player and NPC Nameplates, and Already Known use less CPU: they look the same and redo their work only when something changed.

### Fixed

- **XP Bar Text**: Blizzard's own XP text no longer shows through under ours after a reload.
- **Class Colors**: hostile NPCs' health bars are red, like their names, instead of sometimes yellow or green.
- **Commands**: `/fpp toggle` on a tool, such as Self Test, says it's always on, instead of that it's off.
- **Profession Tooltips**: recolors the "Requires" line on nodes and creatures in languages that number its parts (such as "%1$s"), which it missed before.
- **Character Window**: with Side Tabs on, your level shows above your character again, and your pet's on the pet pane, where the game now puts them.
- **Character Window**: the Skills tab shows your equipped weapons' skills in green right after you log in, instead of only once you change a weapon or reload.
- **Character Window**: durability bars are read again each time the window opens, so they're right after you log in.
- **Auto Decline**: asks for your guild's roster again once your guild is known after logging in, so guildmates' duels aren't declined while Allow Friends and Guild is on.
- **Gathering Tracking**: after logging in, waits a few more seconds for the tracking list to fill before giving up on turning tracking back on.
- Chat Font, Persistent Chat, Short Channel Names, and Chat Copy's Click Timestamps also work in whisper windows popped out into their own tab.
- **Player Nameplates**: Battle.net friend icons and guildmate colors update as those lists change, and names on player and NPC plates get smaller again when you make nameplates smaller.
- **AddOns List**: shows which addons are on for the character picked in the dropdown, or for All, instead of always for you.
- **Item Tooltips**: Auction Prices turned on with the auction house open can scan it without reopening it.
- **Buff Timers**: Edit Mode's example buffs and debuffs don't keep an old clock.
- **Class Colors**: turning name backgrounds off puts back the target frame's own color.
- **Auto Weapon Buff**: right-clicking a stone or oil in your bags at the guild bank deposits it instead of putting it on your weapon.
- **Auto Decline**: Allow Friends and Guild lets party invites from guildmates through even before your guild roster has loaded.

## 0.8.4 (2026-10-11)

### Fixed

- **Item Tooltips**: Waylaid Crate Costs shows each bundle's price again, instead of No price, which 0.8.2 broke.

## 0.8.3 (2026-10-11)

### Fixed

- **Auto Weapon Buff**: right-clicking a stone, oil, poison, or lure in your bags puts it on your weapon again, which 0.8.2 broke.

## 0.8.2 (2026-10-11)

### Changed

- **Auto Weapon Buff**: when no equipped weapon can take the item, like a weightstone with only blades, it says so in red at the top of the screen instead of bringing up a cursor. On by default; turn it off with Warn When No Weapon Fits.
- **Buff Timers**: Show Clock has an Under 1 Minute choice, for a clock only on auras about to run out.
- **Character Window**: the new Equipped Weapon Skills option (on by default) colors the Skills tab's bars green for the weapons you have equipped, instead of blue.
- **Chat History**: no longer saves whispers, so they aren't written to your saved settings file.
- **Console Variables**: laid out like the Modules page: Changed, All, and the game's own categories on the left, each with how many match the search, and their console variables beside it with each one's help text under its name. The Changed group replaces the Changed Only checkbox.
- **Item Tooltips**: the new Waylaid Crate Costs option shows beside each bundle a Waylaid Crate takes what buying it costs at the auction house, from your scanned prices. It can go under each bundle instead, or be turned off.
- **Quest Tracker**: the new Sort by Level option (off by default) lists tracked quests by level, lowest or highest first, instead of in the order you tracked them. It waits for combat to end.
- **Settings**: the Changelog page lists the releases on the left, like the Modules page, with the selected one's notes beside it in larger text. Releases since the version you last saw are marked NEW, and a search box shows only the changes that mention what you type.
- **Talent Planner**: counts the Legacy perk Talented: with it, plans get talent points from level 5 instead of 10, still 51 at most.
- **World Map**: Points of Interest draws spirit healers as a glowing spirit instead of a tombstone, so they aren't mistaken for your corpse.

### Fixed

- **Already Known**: the Tint look no longer turns white the red icons of merchant items you can't use, and the bags only look up items that can be known, like recipes, mounts, and pets.
- **Auto Decline**: a friend or guildmate you let through gets Blizzard's usual invite popup again instead of one showing only their name, and a declined group finder invite closes its popup too.
- **Auto Screenshot**: a second shot right after another no longer shows the interface with Hide Interface on, and a shot the game never reports no longer stops the ones after it.
- **Auto Weapon Buff**: a window over your bags no longer has its clicks taken by a stone, oil, poison, or lure under it.
- **Buff Timers**: never shows a negative time, like -1:59, on an aura about to go away.
- **Commands**: `/rl` and `/clear` are left to another addon that has them even after you've typed a slash command, and turning one on says so in chat.
- **Currency Bar**: stays on screen on smaller screens, and Reset Position puts it back where it starts.
- **Error Catcher**: a link or color in an error shows as plain text in its chat message, and it keeps the last 100 errors with shorter stacks, so its saved file stays small.
- **Flight Timer**: turning Bar on during a flight shows the bar for the rest of it.
- **Hide Beta Feedback**: turning it off puts the quest windows' feedback alert back as it was.
- **Hide Filter Reset**: turning it off gives the mouse back only to the parts that had it before.
- **Item Tooltips**: your own auction house searches keep an item's lowest price instead of the last one listed.
- **Player Nameplates**: a player who turns hostile, like in a duel, gets Blizzard's own nameplate back, health bar and all. So does an NPC that turns hostile with NPC Nameplates on.
- **Player Nameplates**: puts your game settings back at login if it was turned off in combat just before a reload. So do NPC Nameplates, Auto Dismount, and World Map's Coordinates.
- **Quest Nameplates**: an objective that needs 100 of something shows as 37/100, not 37%. Creatures that showed up during a fight get their quest icon once it's over.
- **Recipe Colors**: turning it off clears the tint from every recipe row, not only the ones on screen.
- **Settings**: the Modules page no longer errors when it opens on a module marked NEW.
- **Settings**: Recommended Defaults and Developer's Defaults keep where you moved things and their size in Edit Mode, and reset only the options.
- **Short Channel Names**: turning it off gives channels already in chat their full names again.
- **Social Button**: turning it off no longer leaves Chat Copy's button above the chat window.
- **Talent Planner**: refuses a shared plan with more than 51 points, which could freeze the game, and a shared plan's name can't carry colors, icons, or links.
- **Unusable Items Tint**: no longer tints recipes you can learn because of the item they make, such as plans for mail armor or for gear above your level.
- **Waypoints**: `/way` is left to TomTom or another addon that has it even after you've typed a slash command, and turning Waypoints on says so in chat.
- **World Map**: Zone Info shows herb and ore names in your language the first time, instead of in English until the map changed.

## 0.8.1 (2026-10-10)

### Fixed

- **Auto Weapon Buff**: puts the buff on your weapon again, since Forever blocks the way it did before. Right-click a sharpening stone, weightstone, oil, poison, or fishing lure in your bags and it goes straight onto your weapon, main hand first as before. Not in combat, when the bags work as usual.
- **Settings**: Reset Seen Version on the Debug page goes back to the release before the one you have, so it marks what changed in this release instead of nothing.

## 0.8.0 (2026-10-10)

### Added

- **Talent Planner** (new, on by default, in Interface): a Plan Talents button on the talent window. Place talents freely without learning them, in order, up to the points you have at a level you choose, then follow the plan as you level: its next talent glows, tooltips say at which level each rank comes, and hovering the line beside the button lists the plan in order. A dropdown keeps several named plans, and shares or imports one as a line of text.
- **Commands** (new, on by default, in Interface): short slash commands, each with its own checkbox. `/rl` reloads the UI, and `/clear` empties a chat window. A command another addon already has is left to it.
- **Waypoints** (new, on by default, in Map): `/way [zone] x y` puts the game's map pin on a spot and tracks it (`/way clear` takes it away), unless TomTom or another addon already has `/way`. The new Waypoint Arrow option (on by default) shows an arrow on screen that turns toward the pin, from `/way` or a click on the map, with how far it is. Move and resize it in Edit Mode.
- **Auto Quest** (new, off by default, in Automation): accepts quests and turns in finished ones as you talk to quest givers, one by one down a quest giver's list. It never picks a reward when there's a choice. Accepting and turning in have their own checkboxes, repeatable and shared quests can be left out, and holding Shift (or Ctrl, Alt, or no key) lets you do it yourself.
- **Auto Weapon Buff** (new, off by default, in Automation): using a sharpening stone, weightstone, oil, poison, or fishing lure puts it straight onto your weapon, without clicking the weapon. Main hand first; the off hand when only it can take it, or when the main hand already has a buff and the off hand doesn't (or its buff runs out sooner).
- **Buff Timers** (new, on by default, in Interface): the time left under your buff and debuff icons as a clock, like 1:23, instead of rounded minutes like 2 m. Choose under 10 minutes (the default), under an hour, or always. When the game hides an aura's time in combat, Blizzard's own timer shows.
- **Unusable Items Tint** (new, on by default, in Items): tints red the items you can't use, because of your class, armor or weapon skill, level, or profession, in your bags, the bank, and at merchants, the way merchants tint them. At merchants it only adds what the merchant doesn't already tint, such as gear above your level. Bags, bank, and merchants each have a checkbox.
- **XP Bar Text** (new, on by default, in Interface): the experience bar shows its numbers all the time, with the percent, your rested XP, and the XP of the quests in your log that are ready to turn in (or all of them), in green once turning them in would level you.
- **Minimap Button** (new, on by default, in Interface): Forever++'s own button on the minimap, in the addon compartment, or both. Click it to open Forever++ settings, or right-click it for quick toggles of Fast Loot, Auto Quest, Auto Sell Junk, Auto Stow, Fishing Cast, Gathering Tracking, and Hide Beta Feedback. While Error Catcher is on, Shift-right-click it to see the errors, and it shows how many this session caught. After a fresh install it wears Blizzard's NEW label, and its first click opens the About page.
- **Settings**: a search box at the top of the Modules page shows only the modules whose name, description, or options have what you type, with those options highlighted. The New checkbox beside it shows only the modules marked NEW.
- **Settings**: the Modules page marks new modules, and new or changed options, with Blizzard's NEW label until you've clicked the module, and opens on the first module with a marked option.

### Changed

- **Item Tooltips**: Sell Price, Auction Prices, and Item Count are now one module, Item Tooltips, in Items, with a checkbox for each. Price For and Alignment are shared by all its lines, so they always line up. Your choices, auction prices, and bank counts come along; Sell Price's Price For and Alignment win if they differed.
- **Item Tooltips**: Crafting Costs shows Estimated Profit, after the auction house's 5% cut, and, at the top, how old the oldest auction price in the totals is.
- **World Map**: Points of Interest, Zone Info, Unexplored Areas, and Coordinates are now one World Map module, with a section for each in its options and an Enabled checkbox at the top of each section. Your choices, learned flight points, and ley lines come along.
- **Class Colors**: new Friends and Who List option (on by default) shows online friends' names in the friends list and names in the who list in their class color.
- **Chat Copy**: the window shows chat lines in their chat colors, with names in their class colors and links in theirs, the way they look in chat. Copying still gives plain text.
- **Chat Copy**: new Click Timestamps option (off by default): click a chat line's timestamp to copy that line. Needs the game's chat timestamps turned on.
- **Error Catcher**: its button is now the Minimap Button module, where a click opens settings and a Shift-right-click shows the errors. Turn that module off for no button. Its Clear Key option moved there too: Ctrl-right-click still clears this session's errors. If you had turned Error Catcher's button off, the Minimap Button goes in the addon compartment instead.
- **Settings**: Clutch's Default is now Developer's Defaults, and the welcome page's Defaults button is now Recommended Defaults, matching the Defaults popup on the Modules and Debug pages.
- **Settings**: Forever++ in the AddOns list, `/fpp`, and the minimap button open the Modules page. The welcome page is now the About page, at the bottom of the list, with the version, links, and commands, and the same Defaults button at the top right as the Modules page.
- **Settings**: the Modules page lists every module on the left, each with its checkbox, and shows the one you click on the right: its title, what it does, an Enabled checkbox, and its options and buttons. No more gears or options opening inside the list. Modules with many options group them under headers, and options that only matter while another is on sit under it: Player Nameplates, NPC Nameplates, World Map, Quest Tracker, Profession Tooltips, and Item Tooltips.
- **Settings**: clearer names and descriptions for a few options: Auto Quest's Skip Key, Item Tooltips' Bag and Bank Labels, Unexplored Areas' Tint Strength, and Zone Info's Herbs, Ore, and Skinning.
- **Character Window**: Character Frame Enhancements is now Character Window, so its name fits the Modules list, and Durability Bars is now its Durability Bars option instead of a module of its own (always, only when worn, below 50% or 25%, or off), set to what you had.
- **Auto Screenshot**: now listed under Automation instead of Interface.
- **Auto Screenshot**: new Played Time on Level Up option (off by default) shows your `/played` time in chat when you level up, so it's in the screenshot.
- **Auto Screenshot**: new Your Own Screenshots option (off by default), under Hide Interface, hides the interface for the screenshots you take with the Screenshot key (Print Screen) too, not only Auto Screenshot's. Not in combat.
- **Points of Interest**: new Ley Lines option shows Skyborne ley lines and elemental convergences on the map. A spot is saved when a Skyborne gets the 15-minute buff from Read Ley Line or Skysight there, and every character on the account sees it. Shown to Skyborne for their own kind by default, or to everyone, or to no one.

### Fixed

- **Character Window**: works with Forever's new Titles tab. Titles gets its own side tab, the Pet tab opens your pet's stats again instead of Titles, the titles list starts at the top and runs further down like the stats, and the pet pane keeps your pet's level and loyalty. Your pet's tab also comes and goes with your pet while another tab is open, and a tab you can't use yet (no titles, no pet) says why when you point at it. The side tabs sit as close together as Blizzard's, and get a little smaller when needed, so the last one stays on the window.
- **Console Variables**: an empty list says why (nothing matches the search, or nothing is changed), and a row stays highlighted with its tooltip while you point at its value box or Default button.

## 0.7.0 (2026-10-02)

### Added

- **Best Quest Reward** (new, on by default, in Items): marks the quest reward that sells to a vendor for the most with a gold coin, in the quest window and the quest log.
- **Item Count** (new, off by default, in Items): shows in an item's tooltip how many you own, in your bags and in your bank.
- **Easy Delete** (new, off by default, in Items): types DELETE for you when you destroy a good item.
- **Movable Framerate** (new, off by default, in Interface): move and resize the framerate text (Ctrl+R) in Edit Mode.
- **Auction Prices**: new Crafting Costs option shows a recipe's total cost, value, and profit in the professions window. Reagent tooltips there now price the amount the recipe needs, for Sell Price too.
- **Fishing Cast**: new Combat Warning option warns you when combat starts with a fishing pole equipped.
- **Points of Interest** and **Zone Info**: Forever's new boats and skyships, and the Excavation Site and City of Dalaran dungeons.

### Changed

- **Points of Interest**: Forever's flight masters are named for their places, and its dungeons show in your language.
- **Error Catcher**: a redesigned window with a list of errors and a Copy Bug Report button. Right-click the minimap button to open Forever++ settings.
- **Spell Ranks**: "Higher Rank Known:" in spell tooltips now looks like the other tooltip lines.

### Fixed

- **Edit Mode**: the arrow keys nudge Combat Alert, Currency Bar, and Flight Timer again.
- **Auction Prices**: a price's age is when the item was last seen, not the last scan. Saved prices are cleared once.
- **Sell Price**: no more Lua error on a vendor's buyback tab.

## 0.6.0 (2026-10-01)

### Added

- **Quest Tracker** (new, on by default, in Interface): restyles Blizzard's quest tracker with a font, size, and outline, a dark box behind it that fits your quests, and fading in combat. It's still Blizzard's tracker, so Edit Mode and quest items work as before.
- **Error Catcher** (new, on by default, in Interface): catches Lua errors and blocked actions in place of Blizzard's error popup, saves them per session, and shows them in a window you can copy from (`/fpp errors` or the minimap button). Ctrl-right-click the minimap button to clear this session's errors.
- **Character Frame Enhancements** (new, on by default, in Interface): moves the Character window's Equipment and Pet tabs to the side with the others, removes the portrait and level line so the stats start at the top, and shows your level and name in your class color as the title.
- **Forever Quest Icons** (new, on by default, in Interface): marks quests that are new to Forever with an infinity sign (or the Forever logo) after their name in the quest log, the objective tracker, and quest givers' lists. Idea from ForeverQuestTint.
- **Quest Nameplates**: new Party Progress option to count everyone's progress added up (the default), only yours, or the party member furthest from done. Creatures only a party member needs now show too.
- **Class Colors**: the Names checkbox is now a Name Color choice (Default, White, or Class Color), and a new Name Backgrounds option (on by default) tints the bar behind a player's name on the target and focus frames in their class color.

### Changed

- **Persistent Chat**: renamed from Chat Fading, and now on by default.
- **Auto Repair** and **Auto Sell Junk**: holding Shift to skip is now an option (on by default).
- **Settings**: the Defaults button on the Modules and Debug pages now offers Clutch's Defaults or Recommended Defaults and resets only Forever++. Blizzard's All Settings reset no longer touches Forever++.
- **Settings**: Clutch's Default also sets Zone Info's Dungeons and Fishing to Hold Detail Key.
- **Settings**: Combat Alert, Currency Bar, and Flight Timer are sized and reset only in Edit Mode now.

### Fixed

- **Fishing Cast**: double right-click now casts Fishing.
- **Tooltips**: levels and class names are colored again, player titles show, and the Target line shows the target's name instead of its level.
- **Flight Timer**: no longer draws over other windows.

## 0.5.0 (2026-10-01)

### Added

- **Chat Fading** (new, off by default, in Chat): keeps chat text on screen instead of fading it out after a while.

### Changed

- **Hide Beta Feedback**: also hides the beta's feedback buttons on quest windows (quest, gossip, and quest log), with its own checkbox.
- **Quest Nameplates**: the icon matches the objective: Blizzard's attack, pickup, or interact icon for kill, item, or object objectives, and the quest icon for the rest. A creature whose objective is done shows a green check and its final count (8/8), unless you turn off Show Completed, and the count can be turned off to leave just the check.
- **Player Nameplates and NPC Nameplates**: on name-only plates the buffs sit centered above the name instead of far off to the left. A Buffs setting puts them above, before, or after the name, or back in Blizzard's spot.
- **Profession Tooltips**: the game's own bare "Mining" line under a vein is replaced by "Requires Mining (1)" in the difficulty color instead of showing both. When Blizzard already says "Requires Mining (1)", a bare name line below it shows your skill ("Your Mining skill: 150").
- **Chat History**: the "Earlier chat" line between old and new chat is now an option, off by default.

### Fixed

- **Hide Beta Feedback**: the feedback box on quest windows no longer fades back in.
- **Forever++**: an error in one module no longer stops the others from loading, turning on, or turning off.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-30)

### Added

- **Settings**: Defaults and Clutch's Default buttons on the welcome page, each asking first. Defaults resets every module's settings; Clutch's Default also turns on Fishing Cast, Skip Cinematics, Auto Screenshot, Currency Bar, Hide Beta Feedback, and Short Channel Names.
- **Edit Mode**: Combat Alert, Currency Bar, and Flight Timer work like Blizzard's own frames: click one to select it, then drag it (it snaps to the screen and other frames), nudge it with the arrow keys, or use its Scale slider and Reset To Default Position, also on right-click.
- **Chat** (new category): **Chat Copy** adds a button beside the chat window that opens the chat as plain text to copy. **Short Channel Names** shows [1] instead of [1. General] (off by default). **Chat History** shows each window's latest lines again after a logout or reload. **Social Button** moves the Quick Join button beside the chat's other buttons. **Chat Font** draws chat, and by default the chat input box, in Friz Quadrata or another Blizzard font (not on Korean, Chinese, or Russian clients).

- **Player Nameplates**: an Icon Position option puts the role, friend, and recent ally icons before or after the name.

### Changed

- **Profession Tooltips**: recolors Blizzard's "Requires Mining (1)" line against your skill instead of adding a second one.

### Fixed

- **Auction Prices**: posting works while a scan runs.
- **Player Nameplates** and **NPC Nameplates**: the guild or title no longer overlaps the cast bar.
