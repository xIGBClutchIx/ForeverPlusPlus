# Forever++

Small improvements to the default UI for **WoW: Forever**, made to look like Blizzard's own.

Forever++ isn't a UI replacement: no new unit frames, action bars, or skins. It adds to Blizzard's own windows with Blizzard's fonts, art, and colors, so you can't tell where the game stops and the addon starts. It needs no setup and shows no popups at login. Install it and play.

- **Over 80 modules**, each one turned on or off in the game's Settings, with no `/reload`.
- **Deep customization**: most modules have their own options, all in Blizzard's Settings panel under Options > AddOns > Forever++.
- **Sensible defaults**: the changes nearly everyone wants are on; the rest are there when you want them.
- **Light**: a module that's off costs nothing.

## Settings

Open Game Menu > Options > AddOns > Forever++, or type `/fpp`.

- **Modules**: every module with a checkbox, grouped by category. The search box narrows the list, and New shows only what's new since you last looked. Click a module for what it does and its options.
- **Profiles**: sets of settings for different characters. Everyone starts on Default. Make more, pick which one each character uses, switch live with no reload, and Export or Import one as a line of text.
- **Changelog**: what changed in each release.

A setting you change stays changed, even if a later update changes its default; its undo arrow, or the Defaults button for everything, puts it back. When a module needs one of Blizzard's own settings on, its options say so with a Turn On button.

## Modules

Everything is on by default except where noted. Each module can be turned off, and most have more options than listed here; each option is explained in Settings.

### Automation

- **Auto Decline**: Turns down duel requests, and optionally party invites, guild invites, and guild charters, saying who asked. Friends and guildmates can be let through. Off by default.
- **Auto Dismount**: Dismounts or stands you up when a spell, flight, loot, or attack fails because you're mounted or sitting. Can also leave shapeshift forms.

Off by default.

### Map

- **World Map**: Adds to the world map in four parts, each with its own checkbox.

- **Player Nameplates**: Always shows friendly players' names and guilds, with the health bar only when they're hurt or in combat. Options for sizes, a level badge, class icons, and dimming players outside your group, guild, and friends. In dungeons and raids the game keeps Blizzard's own.
- **Simplified Dungeon Nameplates**: Turns on the game's Simplified nameplates only inside dungeons and raids, for the kinds you pick. Off by default.

## Install

Get it from CurseForge or Wago. To install it by hand, unzip it into the Forever client's AddOns folder, for example `World of Warcraft\_forever_\Interface\AddOns\`, so you end up with `AddOns\ForeverPlusPlus\ForeverPlusPlus.toc`, then start the game or `/reload`.

## For addon authors

Other addons can read Forever++'s auction prices, disenchant values, upgrade scores, flight times, players seen, colors, dungeon levels, and module settings, set waypoints, and add modules of their own, through `ForeverPlusPlusAPI.v1`. See the [API documentation](https://github.com/xIGBClutchIx/ForeverPlusPlus/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## How it's made

Forever++ is coded with AI by a longtime WoW addon developer, and every feature is tested in the game before it ships.
