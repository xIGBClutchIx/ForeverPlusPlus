-- The release notes the Changelog page in Settings shows, newest first. The game can't read
-- CHANGELOG.md at the repo root, so this is the same notes as data: change both together.
-- Headings and module names come from ns.L; the notes themselves are English, like CHANGELOG.md.
-- Each release: `version`, `date`, and `sections` of `{ heading, entries }`, where an entry is a
-- line of text or `{ name, text }` (a name shown in gold before its text). Changes not released
-- yet go first, with `version = L.CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED` and no date.
