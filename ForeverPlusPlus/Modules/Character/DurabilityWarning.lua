-- Durability Warning: says once when the most worn equipped item drops below the durability the
-- player picks, and once more when an item breaks, so they repair before it does. Each way of
-- saying it is its own option: a chat line naming the item, red text in the middle of the screen
-- where the game says "Inventory is full" (the game's own place for a short warning, so it needs
-- no frame of ours to place in Edit Mode), and a sound from ns.Sounds.
--
-- It warns only when the level gets worse (ns.Durability.ShouldWarn): low, then broken. Repairing,
-- or taking the item off, brings the level back down, and the next drop warns again. Durability
-- events come in bursts (every hit in a fight), so a look waits for them to settle. After logging
-- in, gear that's already low gets one quiet warning (chat only) once the world has loaded; a
-- reload or a loading screen says nothing new.
