-- Upgrade Arrows' stat weights: a template per role, which talent tab of each class uses which,
-- what each tab changes, and the profile a character judges gear by (its template plus what
-- the player changed, saved per profile). The root numbers (attack power, hit, crit, spell
-- damage, healing, regen, defense, weapon damage) are Forever++'s own, worked out from Classic
-- 1.x mechanics per point of a stat and per 1% of a chance stat; the attributes follow from the
-- game's own conversions (below). docs/stat-weights.md has every tree's numbers, the arithmetic
-- behind them, and the sources (Classic stat guides, Forever's rating table). The orderings
-- agree with Icy Veins' Classic and WoW Forever guides. Not another addon's tables.

-- Role templates. DPS is a main-hand or two-handed weapon's, DPS_OFF an off-hand weapon's, and
-- DPS_RANGED a ranged weapon's (Lib/ItemStats.lua, Slotted). Every value is a multiple of 0.01,
-- the page's slider step, so a default sits on a step and never reads as changed. The scale:
-- 1 attack power is 0.5 for melee and hunters (so 1 Strength is 1 for a class that gets 2 attack
-- power from it), 1 spell damage is 1 for casters, 1 healing for healers, 1 Stamina for tanks.
-- 14 attack power is 1 weapon DPS, so a main hand's DPS is 7 before talents that hit with it.
-- Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Intellect are placeholders: for the character's own class
-- they're worked out from the game's conversions and the root weights (attack power, crit,
-- dodge, armor, health, spell crit, mana; Lib/ItemStats.lua, DeriveAttributes), so 1 Agility on
-- a Rogue is worth what the game says it gives. The placeholders serve another class's trees
-- and a client that can't answer. Spirit stays a judgment: its regen counts only outside the
